# IcoGrab

A simple script to grab user icons in GitHub and save them. To be implemented into Comrat.

All images are saved to `images/$username.jpg`

## Usage

After pasting this code into your node project (sorry, working on making this an npm module), run `grabIcon(username, force, callback);`. Callback takes two arguments - the username and a boolean as to whether or not the image was overwritten.

Have fun!
